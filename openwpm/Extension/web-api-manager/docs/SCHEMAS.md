Purpose
---
This document describes the different ways that user preferences were serialized
to storage. This is mostly useful to understand the migrations performed by
`add-on/lib/migrations.js`.

The below data structures match exactly what stored in `storage.set`, and
so match what should be returned by `storage.get("webApiManager", callback)`.

Version 1

```

    "webApiManager": {
        "domainRules": {
            "first match pattern <string>": [

                "id of another standard, taken from the info.id property of the standard definition",
                etc...
            ],
